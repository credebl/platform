# CREDEBL SSI Platform

This repository hosts the codebase for CREDEBL SSI Platform backend.

## Prerequisites

### Install Docker and Docker Compose
See: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

### Install Node.js
Version: >= 18.17.0  
See: https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/

### Install NestJS CLI
```bash
npm i @nestjs/cli@latest 
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Setup and Run PostgreSQL
Start the PostgreSQL service using Docker:

```bash
docker run --name some-postgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<secretpassword> -e POSTGRES_USER=credebl -d postgres
```

### 2. Run Prisma to Generate Database Schema

```bash
cd ./libs/prisma-service/prisma
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

### 3. Seed Initial Data

```bash
cd ./libs/prisma-service
npx prisma db seed
```

## Install NATS Message Broker

### Pull NATS Docker Image

NATS is used for inter-service communication. The only prerequisite here is to install Docker.

```bash
docker pull nats:latest
```

### Run NATS using Docker Compose
The `docker-compose.yml` file is available in the root folder.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Run CREDEBL Microservices

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Configure Environment Variables
Configure environment variables in `.env` before you start the API Gateway.

### Running the API Gateway
You can optionally use the `--watch` flag during development/testing.

```bash
nest start [--watch]
```

### Starting Individual Microservices

For example, to start the `organization service` microservice, run the following command in a separate terminal window:

```bash
nest start organization [--watch]
```

Start all the microservices one after another in separate terminal windows:

```bash
nest start user [--watch]
nest start ledger [--watch]
nest start connection [--watch]
nest start issuance [--watch]
nest start verification [--watch]
nest start agent-provisioning [--watch]
nest start agent-service [--watch]
```

## Access Microservice Endpoints

To access microservice endpoints using the API Gateway, navigate to:

```
http://localhost:5000/api
```

## Credit

The CREDEBL platform is built by AYANWORKS team. 
For the core SSI capabilities, it leverages the great work from multiple open-source projects such as Hyperledger Aries, Bifold, Asker, Indy, etc.
